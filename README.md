# *Genshin Impact* wish tracker

## Optimized wishing

*Genshin Impact*, an open-world RPG game developed by
HoYoverse, has a "gacha" component which is central
to the progression of the game. The term "gacha" 
is derived from *Gashapon* machines in Japan where
a toy is dispensed at random. In the context of
video games, "gacha" refers to a mechanic where in-game
items are obtained at random. *Genshin Impact*
implements this in the form of **wishing**: by using
in-game currency, one is given a random chance to 
obtain exclusive items. Although some items
in *Genshin Impact* are obtained through non-gacha
means, the vast majority must be **wished** for.


 This project will serve to record wishes, differentiate 
 wishes done on each *banner*, and calculate the probability 
 that the next wish will grant a rare item. Players will 
 prefer this tool over the in-game wish history since the 
 in-game implementation is limited in that it will
 lose track of wishes done too long ago. This project is of
 interest to me since the wishing mechanic is complex
 in terms of probability, and the game does not provide the
 tools needed to use the mechanic optimally. I have also 
 lost my wish history to time several times after relying 
 on the in-game wish history.
